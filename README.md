Vaksancayah introduces free Sanskrit speech corpus and aims to make Sanskrit speech recognition more broadly accessible to everyone.

We are using 56 hours transcribed Sanskrit audio for training data (34,309 utterances, 12 people) and 10 hours transcribed Sanskrit audio for testing data (5531 utterances, 5 people).

The database can be also downloaded from Anonymous google drive:
